# The Document Class

**Scope:** Describe the agnostics class 'Document' to understand what is inherited by child classes, and what is not.

---
The 'Document' class is designed to be an agnostic class to store JSON values from all document types originating from the Federal Register. This is inentionally designed to be as open format as possible, so that the class might be used for documents from other sources, letting us create a truly generic 'Document' class for this specific project.
